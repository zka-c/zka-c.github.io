NihaoÔºÅ

I'm Zikang Chen from China, and now focus on an Chinese-English subtitle translation. I got my master's degree in translation from Guangxi University, where I have systematically learned a lot of translation knowledge, studied a lot of translation theories, and have very solid translation skills. Studying make me fall in love with translation industry and I start my carreer as a translator.

I have worked many years in the industry where a wealth of experience has been accumulated, especially in subtitle translation. Now I have translated up to 100,000 words of subtitles. The organizations I have worked with include: Coursera, Amara, Ted, TranslationCommons, and so on. Recently, as participated in many volunteer activities for subtitle translation, I am determined to fight in this industry even more. In the process, my translation skills have improved a lot and horizons have also been greatly broadened.
