**You've likely heard it all by this point. Your writing is crucial. Additionally, your website serves as the marketplace for your content. It will receive more traffic the more apparent it is.**

Naturally, you will gain greater visibility and income if there is more traffic. This is a truth that all prosperous businesses—whether they are producing items, offering services, or developing software for games or SaaS—are aware of. These companies localize their websites in order to maximize content.

I've known for a while that connecting with consumers who speak Chinese languages is the main benefit of localizing your website (and allowing them to purchase your items), but I wanted to uncover some user engagement numbers for this piece to more thoroughly explore the subject. There are some very strong statistics available.

Each of these facts, in my opinion, strengthens the case for localizing websites. The research endeavor by Nimdzi lasted eight months and covered 66 languages in 74 countries. The startling statistic that nine out of ten consumers will disregard your product if it is not available in their native tongue pretty much sums up the necessity for website localization on its own!

The statistics from the European Commission is also intriguing. It demonstrates that people within Europe appear to be slightly more receptive to shopping in foreign tongues—but only slightly! The statistics provided by the Commission also highlight the importance of localizing websites for purposes other than e-commerce. Why not make your business the one that speaks to them in their own language and stands out from the competition if 44% of internet users feel that they are missing out on information because it is not available in their language?

W3Tech's statistics have always been an intriguing source of information for me. According to business statistics as of August 11, 2020, English is used on 60% of all websites. Spanish is the next closest language, at 4.0%, followed by Russian at 8.6%. Eight additional languages make up between 1.1% and 3.9% of the information on the web, while 177 other languages make up 1.0% or less. Despite being the most spoken language in the world, Mandarin only makes up 1.5% of all webpages (by number of native speakers).

Chinese and Spanish are two excellent instances of this. Clearly, there are some potential hidden within those mismatches between lesser-used languages on the web and vast populations that understand them.

With a larger and wealthier consumer base, China's market has grown more alluring to foreign businesses as they have increased their presence to match the changing demands of Chinese consumers over the past ten years.

International businesses have been actively growing their footprint in China over the past ten years.

So don’t miss the biggest market!
