No matter what sector of business you are in, your marketing plan probably includes video material. If it's not, it should be; otherwise. By 2022, online videos will account for more than 82% of all consumer internet traffic, according to a Cisco report. Additionally, 72% of consumers prefer watching a video to understand more about a good or service. Even so, videos won't suddenly take your marketing success and customer engagement to the next level. The online market is crowded, cutthroat, and evolving quickly. Users must engage with the content as well as slow their scrolling. And the answer is really straightforward yet sometimes disregarded when it comes to video content: closed captions.

Your online video content will be much more successful if you add English captions or foreign language subtitles. I'm here to explain why as a professional captioner and subtitler, so please read on:
Including captions in your video is a quick and simple technique to increase its SEO. Though they cannot view your video content, search engines like Google can crawl your captions or transcripts and rank your video according to the keywords they discover. Although the title, description, and tags of your video will also be indexed for SEO purposes, captions will boost your keyword density and diversity even more.

It is practically a given that adding captions to your movies will increase engagement, interaction, and conversion. According to an Instapage case study, after adding subtitles to their Facebook videos, call-to-action clicks climbed by 25%. According to an another study, subtitles make viewers 80% more likely to watch a movie all the way through and extend their viewing time by nearly 40%. All it takes to increase clicks, overall view duration, and view longevity is to add subtitles to video material.

About "two-thirds of a channel's views come from outside the creator's home country," claims YouTube. Consider the possibility that a sizable section of your audience will not fully grasp your message or understand your call to action. You are passing over a sizable pool of potential customers.

Spending a lot of time, money, and effort on making the perfect video while omitting the essential component can prevent your message from reaching as many people as possible. Your social media video material will be more successful overall if it is properly captioned and subtitled. This will enhance views, comprehension, and engagement. Additionally, this is a simple marketing tweak that can actually have a large impact.
