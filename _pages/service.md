## The Benefits of Subtitle Translation

There are so many benefits of subtitling a video. The first use of subtitles is to present videos to those who donâ€™t speak the language that the audio element is recorded in. This was the case with my recent video translation client. She wanted to share her video with audiences who spoke Mandarin, but without re-recording the audio element of it. As such, she planned to keep the sound in English while providing Chinese subtitles. My professional subtitle translation service was just what she required. 

As such, subtitling your videos can mean opening them up to huge new Chinese audiences.

The first task was to transcribe the video. As an experienced transcriptionist, I can quickly and accurately capture the content of the file, ready for translation and subtitling.

## Fast Delivery for Busy Clients

In this instance, our client needed her subtitles in a hurry, as she was keen to share her video with new audiences and thus get the best possible returns for the funds she had spent on making it. 

I'm set up to handle rush translations of this nature, so I lost no time in producing accurate Mandarin subtitles, ready for the client to apply them to her video. The client was absolutely delighted with the speed of our service, as well as with the high quality of the translations.
